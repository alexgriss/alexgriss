Hi, I'm Aleksandr, a JavaScript developer from Saint-Petersburg, this is my GitHub profile.

I have a nice repo with modern lightweight boilerplate (typescript, react, webpack), here is a link: https://github.com/alexgriss/boiler-replate

I'm trying to make projects using Web Audio API and WASM compiled algorithms for pitch and time recognition of an input sound from an audio source (like [Aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio)).

Here is a link to a tuner application: https://github.com/alexgriss/tuner

The tuner application is based on FrequencyRecognizerNode class and works with Aubio: https://github.com/alexgriss/frequency-recognizer

I have passion for interfaces and for good architecture and code solutions, I'm always looking for interesting ideas and think that you need to at least try do to great things even they are hard.
